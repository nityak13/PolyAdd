Some of the applications are-\r\n\r\n* Ensuring that the input strings have sufficiently allocated memory for the character data and the null terminator over a bounded array.\r\n* Used terminating loops to manage string index out of range.\r\n* We ensured sanitation of inputs in our Number Handler and String Handler blocks.\r\n* Implemented try and catch blocks to handle exceptional behavior.\r\n* After allocating memory for the files and performing the operation, the files in memory are properly deallocated to prevent access to this in memory. These get deleted to prevent it's misuse.\r\n*Ensured that the capture variables are in the correct long format, and read the data only upon a successful match.\r\n\r\n",
