<p>This program is used for the summation of an n degree polynomial where the input is in the form of two files consisting of an input polynomial in each file.</p>

<p>The code implementation required the use of the following parts-</p>

<ul>
<li>The File Handler for taking in the file containing polynomial inputs.</li>
<li>The String Handler for taking in the polynomial inputs which were in the form of a string.</li>
<li>Number Handler for conversion of the string to number.</li>
<li>And finally the Polynomial Addition block to perform the addition operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>While constructing the code, care was taken to apply the rules and recommendations for Memory and String as per the SEI CERT Coding Standards. Some of the applications are-</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the input strings have sufficiently allocated memory for the character data and the null terminator over a bounded array.</li>
<li>Used terminating loops to manage string index out of range.</li>
<li>We ensured sanitation of inputs in our Number Handler and String Handler blocks.</li>
<li>Implemented try and catch blocks to handle exceptional behavior.</li>
<li>After allocating memory for the files and performing the operation, the files in memory are properly deallocated to prevent access to this in memory. These get deleted to prevent it's misuse.
*Ensured that the capture variables are in the correct long format, and read the data only upon a successful match.</li>
</ul>
